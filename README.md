# magnetSim
Eddy current simulation on a non-magnetic plate by a magnetic field generated by a coil

Note:
- This project is meant to be compiled using Visual Studio 2019
- It has a dependency on freeglut which is really not needed. Only if you're using Windows
- There are no makefiles. You can create your own if you want to
- There's also a dependency with OpenMP which is needed to parallelize the magnetic field calculation
